It includes information about each transaction including customer details, the merchant and category of purchase, and whether or not the transaction was a fraud.\n\nNote: You can access the data via the File menu or in the Context Panel at the top right of the screen next to Report, under Files. The data dictionary and filenames can be found at the bottom of this workbook.\n\n[Source: Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kartik2112/fraud-detection?select=fraudTrain.csv) The data was partially cleaned and adapted by DataCamp.\n\nWe've added some guiding questions for analyzing this exciting dataset!

The company is promoting itself as one of the safest credit cards to use. They have hired you as their data scientist in charge of identifying instances of fraud. The executive who hired you has have provided you with data on credit card transactions, including whether or not each transaction was fraudulent.\n\n**Objective:** The executive wants to know how accurately you can predict fraud using this data. She has stressed that the model should err on the side of caution: it is not a big problem to flag transactions as fraudulent when they aren't just to be safe. In your report, you will need to describe how well your model functions and how it adheres to these criteria.\n\nYou will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It will need to outline your motivation, analysis steps, findings, and conclusions.","metadata":{},"id":"74df9d67-90cd-4332-baa5-4d46612a092f","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"You can query the pre-loaded CSV file using SQL directly.
